// Yes, I know all density and unit costs for SciFi Resources are 0. This will remain so until a consensus is reached. Flow modes and transfer modes are also up for debate.

// Spatiofibrin, used in Polyspatial and Stutterwarp Drives. Requires Handwavium and Unobtainium to refine.

// MacGuffinite, used to boost efficiency in reactors when used in conjunction with fissile/fusiles. Required material for refining Trilithium, used by certain FTL drives in addition with base resource (i.e. exotic matter or spatiofibrin). Also used for the construction of medium-tier armor plating with EPL or OSE Workshop.

// WIP

// Thorium-234, byproduct of Uranium-239 production through Uranium-235 and Uranium-238. Must be stored in a radioactive material container.

// Uranium-235, produced by decay of Plutonium-239. Also used in production of Uranium-239 and Thorium-234 with Uranium-238. Must be stored in a radioactive material container.

// Uranium-238, used in production of Uranium-239 and Thorium-234 with Uranium-235. Cannot be used in a fission reactor. Must be stored in a radioactive material container.

// Uranium-239, produced in a breeder reactor with Uranium-238 and Uranium-235. Decays into Neptunium-239 in a decay chamber. Must be stored in a radioactive material container.

// Neptunium-239, decay product of Uranium-239 in a decay chamber. Decays into Plutonium-239 in a decay chamber, which can be used in a fission reactor. Must be stored in a radioactive material container.
